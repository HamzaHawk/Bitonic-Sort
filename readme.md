Bitonic Sort
---------------
This is an example implementation of a distributed bitonic sorting algorithm in C++ using OpenMPI, it has not been optimized for speed but is instead meant to be an example of how bitonic sort works.

Notes
-------------
* Runs on OpenMPI CPU clusters (requires boost-mpi)
* Node partners are calculated using a hyper-cube
* Video of the program sorting 16,000,000 random nubmers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1YBOE60Hwo


Compile
------------
Use Eclipse project files.
