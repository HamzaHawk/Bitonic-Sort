Bitonic Sort
---------------
This is an example implementation of a bitonic sorting algorithm, it has not been optimized and is meant to only be an example of how bitonic sort works.  

Notes
-------------
* Runs on OpenMPI CPU clusters (requires boost-mpi)
* Node partners are calculated using a hyper-cube
* Video of the program sorting 16,000,000 random nubmers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1YBOE60Hwo
